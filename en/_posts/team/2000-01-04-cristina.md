Cristina comes from the Canary Islands in Spain so her love and respect for nature are in her from birth. Recently arrived to Leipzig from Dublin but had heard about Kunststofferei before moving so she was signed into the group way before she had registered as a Leipziger. Started her zero waste journey a few years ago in Dublin switching to reusable options and unpacked grocery stores and second hand clothes shops. All the furniture in her Leipzig apartment was either brought from Dublin or bought second hand. Collaborated on a green campaign at Facebook HQs in Dublin to give reusable water bottles to all employees and created a collection point for crisp packets to send them to [Terracycle](https://www.terracycle.com/en-IE). Still so much to learn but she is committed to make the effort and learn about daily changes and decisions that will make a difference to both her life and the planet!
