Susan ten Hoeve, born in the Netherlands, did her Bachelor in Industrial Product Design & Engineering. During her study she lived a while in The Gambia where she taught locals how to make new products out of Plastic waste. After her study she worked for a company where she mostly created things out of... plastic. It bothered her a lot and she spoke to the owners. After that every employee had an hour per week to work voluntarily on a sustainable project. But restless as she is, she couldn’t stay there longer than 3 years. So she decided to sell all her belongings and travel the world. After a year she ended up in Leipzig, where one of her dreams came true, starting a Precious Plastics workshop and finally making sustainable products. When she’s not in the workspace, you can find her in one of the many Lost Places in Leipzig.
