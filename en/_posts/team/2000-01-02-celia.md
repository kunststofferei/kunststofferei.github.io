CÃ©lia is originally from Hungary and has recently moved from Dublin where she was one of the co-founders of [Precious Plastic Dublin](https://www.preciousplasticdublin.org/). She is amazed by the Precious Plastic Universe, especially its community aspect. She has been intensively involved with the Zero Waste movement for the last couple of years and is now coordinating the [Zero Waste Living in Leipzig](http://zerowastelivinginleipzig.de/) community group. In the rare occasion that she actually does create some plastic waste, she would prefer to upcycle it herself locally than shipping it off into the unknown. You can follow her Zero Waste Adventures on her [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/zerowaste.adventures/).
