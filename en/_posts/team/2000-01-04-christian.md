Christian Berens works in the fields of artistic design research, using practices of exploratory city exploration, naive buildings and sampled action research, on participation, meeting and exchange formats. He is currently interested in construction sites as heterotopias of transition and change. His interest in urban mining, citizen science and local sustainable production led him to Kunststofferei. His dream goal would be to build a children's science fiction institute for the practical exploration of future habitats. He sees plastic-recycling as part of this project. Find out more about Christian and his work on his [personal website](https://christianberens.de).
