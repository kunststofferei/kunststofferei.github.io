Iris Pop was born and raised in Transylvania, Romania, where she did her Bachelor’s studies in Communication and Public Relations. She always felt the urge to go out to discover more, so there she went: she lived a summer in the USA, did her Master’s studies in France and finally settled down in Germany. In her perfect world, there are no borders that need to be passed, no plastic bags in the ocean and no food over-production. A sustainable lifestyle and a conscious consumption were always big on her list, however it was only during an eye-opening trip from Europe to New Zealand that she saw the disturbing results of reckless consumerism and plastic pollution. She then got involved in awareness-creating activities and intensively dealt with sustainability-related topics, such as zero-waste, food-waste and recycling - and that’s how she got to be part of the Kunststofferei team.
