Phil Ruthig is a relative newcomer to the plastic recycling scene. He studied Neuroscience and is busy with his PhD at [Uni Leipzig](https://www.uni-leipzig.de/) and the [Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/en). In summer 2020, his focus expanded to plastic recycling after he won funding for sustainable engagement ([Mitmachfonds Sachsen, Kategorie ReWIR](https://www.mitmachfonds-sachsen.de/)). After a short and very fruitful networking session with the local scene, he co-founded the Kunststofferei in June 2020. When he is not busy with recycling plastic or wondering how brains work, youâ€™ll most likely find him climbing some boulder or surfing across stormy waters with his kite.
