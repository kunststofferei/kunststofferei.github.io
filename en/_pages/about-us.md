## Mission


Kunststofferei is an open collective working on practical solutions to divert plastic from nature, incinerators and landfills by closing the plastic recycling loop locally.

As part of the [Precious Plastic Universe](https://preciousplastic.com/en/index.html), we want to rethink our single-use mentality and aim to create long-lasting, useful and recyclable products from locally sourced plastic waste.
We hope that together we can foster a more sustainable use of plastics in our society and implement the principles of a true circular economy – value creation instead of wastefulness – on a regional scale.

## Milestones

#### October 2020...

... the team bought a second-hand industrial shredder and named it Töge.

#### July 2020...

... In July 2020, [Trash Galore](https://trashgalore.de/) offered the team a physical space to start to establish their first preliminary workshop in.

#### June 2020...

... Phil got the good news that his project - Make Plastic recycling local and create art at the same time -  was selected to receive a €5000 prize.

Shortly after, a team of scientists, climate activists, product designers and craftspersons  gathered and started the discussion on how to turn the ideas into actions and promptly founded the Kunststofferei.

#### Early 2020...

...  the first big step was when Phil applied for the [Sachsen Mitmachen Fonds 2020](https://www.mitmachfonds-sachsen.de/).
