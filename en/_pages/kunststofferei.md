## Mission

Kunststofferei is an open collective working on practical solutions to divert plastic from nature, incinerators and landfills by closing the plastic recycling loop locally.

As part of the [Precious Plastic Universe](https://preciousplastic.com/), we want to rethink our single-use mentality and aim to create long-lasting, useful and recyclable products from locally sourced plastic waste.
We hope that together we can foster a more sustainable use of plastics in our society and implement the principles of a true circular economy – value creation instead of wastefulness – on a regional scale.

## Milestones

#### October 2020

The team bought a second-hand industrial shredder and named it Töge. We also repaired an old lab-oven we scavenged from skips which will hopefully become our compression molding machine. Oh yeah, and our super talented member Peter came up with an arbour press design and realized it using mostly used parts - we'll try that for cold pressing sheets in the upcoming weeks.

#### July 2020

We found a home at [Trash Galore](https://trashgalore.de/) who generously offered us a physical space with two workshop rooms which can host our machines and plastic.

#### June 2020

Phil got good news. His project "Make Plastic recycling local and create art at the same time" was awarded 5000 EUR through the [Ideenwettbewerb Sächsische Mitmach-fonds](https://www.mitmachfonds-sachsen.de/). This money allowed us to get going, purchase the first machines and part and personal safety equipment. How exciting!

Shortly after, a team of scientists, climate activists, product designers and craftspersons gathered and started the discussion on how to turn the ideas into actions and promptly founded the Kunststofferei. Here we are!
