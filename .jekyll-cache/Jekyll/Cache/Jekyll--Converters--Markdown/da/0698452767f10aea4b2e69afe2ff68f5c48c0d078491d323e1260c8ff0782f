I"<p>Phil is a relative newcomer to the plastic recycling scene. He studied Neuroscience and is busy with his PhD at <a href="https://www.uni-leipzig.de/">Uni Leipzig</a> and the <a href="https://www.cbs.mpg.de/en">Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences</a>. In summer 2020, his focus expanded to plastic recycling after he won funding for sustainable engagement (<a href="https://www.mitmachfonds-sachsen.de/">Mitmachfonds Sachsen, Kategorie ReWIR</a>). After a short and very fruitful networking session with the local scene, he co-founded the Kunststofferei in June 2020. When he is not busy with recycling plastic or wondering how brains work, youâ€™ll most likely find him climbing some boulder or surfing across stormy waters with his kite.</p>
