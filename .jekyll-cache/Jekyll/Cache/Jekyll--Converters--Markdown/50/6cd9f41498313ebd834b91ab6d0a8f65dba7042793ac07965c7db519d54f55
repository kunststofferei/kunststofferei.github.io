I"¦<p>During the day, Jan is an Environmental Scientist working at <a href="https://www.ufz.de/">Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ)</a> and interested in everything related to blue-green technologies and sustainable water and wastewater management. He spends most of his days either at one of the test sites or tucked behind his computer in the office crunching numbers. At night (if he is not out dumpster diving), Jan is haunted by nightmares about all the single-use plastic that ends up in our environment. We still cannot account for about two thirds of all the plastic ever produced. To finally be able to sleep in peace again one day, he joined the Precious Plastic team, first in Dublin where he lived until summer 2020, and now at Kunststofferei here in Leipzig.
