<h2 id="cookies">Cookies</h2>

<p>Our website makes use of cookies in order to recognize repeat use of our website by the same user/internet connection subscriber. Cookies are small text files that your internet browser downloads and stores on your computer and are used to improve our website and services. In most cases these are so-called “session cookies” that are deleted once you leave our website.</p>

<p>Data such as the following, which your internet browser transmits to us or to our web space provider (so called server log files), are collected:</p>

<ul>
  <li>type and version of the browser you use</li>
  <li>operating system</li>
  <li>websites that linked you to our site (referrer URL)</li>
  <li>websites that you visit</li>
  <li>date and time of your visit</li>
  <li>your Internet Protocol (IP) address.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can prevent cookies from being installed by adjusting the settings in your browser accordingly.</p>

<h2 id="web-analytics">Web analytics</h2>

<p>This anonymous data is stored separately from any personal information you may have provided, thereby making it impossible to connect it to any particular person. The data is used for statistical purposes in order to improve our website and services. All visitor IP addresses are anonymised before being submitted to Google Analytics and deleted automatically from Google Analytics servers after 14 months.</p>

<p>Our website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA, hereinafter referred to as “Google”. Google Analytics employs so-called “cookies”, text files that are stored to your computer in order to facilitate an analysis of your use of the site. The information generated by these cookies, such as time, place and frequency of your visits to our site, including your IP address, is transmitted to Google’s location in the US, stored there, and deleted automatically from Google Analytics servers after 14 months. In using Google Analytics our website employs the extension, “_gat._anonymizeIp”. In doing so, Google abbreviates and thereby anonymizes your IP address before transferring it from member states of the European Union or signatory states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Google uses this information to analyze your use of our site, to compile reports for us on internet activity and to provide other services relating to website and internet use. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law or where such third parties process this data on Google’s behalf. Google states that it will in never associate your IP address with other data held by Google. You can prevent cookies from being installed by adjusting the settings on your browser software accordingly. You should be aware, however, that by doing so you may not be able to make full use of all the functions of our website. Furthermore, Google offers a deactivation add-on for most current browsers that provides you with more control over what data Google can collect on websites you access. The add-on tells the JavaScript (ga.js) used by Google Analytics not to transmit any information about website visits to Google Analytics. However, the browser deactivation add-on offered by Google Analytics does not prevent information from being transmitted to us or to other web analysis services we may engage. You can find additional information on how to install the browser add-on at the following link:

To the best of our knowledge, Twitter collects the URL of each website accessed as well as the IP address of the user, but does so solely for the purpose of displaying Twitter components.

<h2 id="use-of-youtube-components">Use of YouTube components</h2>

<p>We use YouTube plug-ins provided by YouTube, LLC. 901 Cherry Ave. San Bruno, CA 94066, USA (a service of Google, Inc.), to enable you to view YouTube videos embedded on our site. When you play a YouTube video on our site, you will receive a cookie from www.youtube.com. By clicking to play the video, you are assumed to consent to this cookie being used.

<p>The IP address provided as part of “reCAPTCHA” is not merged with other data from Google unless you are logged into your Google Account at the time the “reCAPTCHA” plug-in is used. If you want to prevent this transmission and storage of data by “Google” about you and your behaviour on our website, you must log out of “Google” before you visit our site or before using the reCAPTCHA plug-in.</p>

<p>The use of the “reCAPTCHA” service is according to the Google Terms of Use:
